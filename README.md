## Insights :
1. Initially, after Airbnb’s launch, both the number of listings and prices increased, driven by early traction and adoption by early users.
2. As the platform gained widespread popularity and became a mainstream option, the number of listings continued to grow, but prices began to decline due to higher supply.
3. Around 2015, regulatory announcements created uncertainty in the market. This led to a decrease in the number of listings, while prices rose—likely due to reduced supply and increased risk perception among hosts.
4. By 2019, with regulations becoming the norm, the number of listings began to rise again. However, prices decreased, likely as a result of increased supply and market stabilization.
## Recommendation :
1. Regulations in long term rentals can impact the business adversely, there might be customer and hosts churn due to uncertainty.
2. Such regulations might add to AirBnBs losses which might be difficult to recover later.
3. If the customer experience is going to get impacted due to this, it would lead to incorrect brand perception.
4. It is recommended to watch out for any such regulations at other places and be prepared for it.
5. AirBnB can replicate such regulations at other places.
6. They can keep strict rules to onboard and release the hosts.
7. They can limit the number of AirBnBs in a locality to ensure the public has enough rental options and the government doesn't step in.
